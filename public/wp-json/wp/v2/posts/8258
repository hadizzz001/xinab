Divorce can be a difficult and emotional time, but having a clear understanding of the steps involved can help alleviate some of the stress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Lebanon, divorce is governed by the Matrimonial Causes (Lebanon) Order 1978. To initiate the divorce process, one spouse must file a petition with the court. The grounds for divorce can be based on either fault or separation. Fault-based grounds include adultery, unreasonable behaviour, or desertion. Alternatively, separation-based grounds require that the couple has been living apart for at least two years and both parties agree to the divorce, or that they have been living apart for at least five years, even if one party does not agree to the divorce.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the petition has been filed, the other spouse has the opportunity to respond. If both parties agree to the divorce and all related issues such as property division and child custody have been settled, the divorce can be granted relatively quickly. However, if there are disputes or disagreements, the process can become more complex and may require court hearings and mediation. Understanding the divorce process in Lebanon can help you be better prepared for the road ahead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Legal Grounds for Divorce<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In Lebanon, there are five legal grounds for divorce, which are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Adultery<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Unreasonable behaviour<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Desertion for a continuous period of at least two years<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Separation for a continuous period of at least two years with the consent of both parties<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Separation for a continuous period of at least five years, regardless of the other party&#8217;s consent<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to note that the adultery must have taken place before the divorce petition was issued, and it cannot be relied upon if you have continued to live with your spouse for more than six months after discovering the adultery.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unreasonable behaviour can include a wide range of behaviours, such as physical or verbal abuse, financial irresponsibility, or refusal to engage in sexual activity. It is important to provide specific examples of the behaviour in question when making this claim.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Desertion is when one spouse leaves the other without their consent and without a good reason, such as domestic abuse. The period of desertion must be continuous for at least two years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Separation is when spouses have been living apart from each other for a continuous period of at least two years with both parties&#8217; consent, or for a continuous period of at least five years without the other party&#8217;s consent. It is important to note that living apart does not necessarily mean living in separate houses, as long as the separation is genuine and not just a temporary arrangement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Eligibility Requirements<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are considering getting a divorce in Lebanon, there are certain eligibility requirements that you must meet. These requirements include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You or your spouse must have lived in Lebanon for at least one year before filing for divorce.<br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>You must be able to prove that your marriage has irretrievably broken down. This can be done by demonstrating one of the following:<br>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Adultery committed by your spouse.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Unreasonable behaviour by your spouse.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Desertion by your spouse for a continuous period of at least two years.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Separation for a continuous period of at least two years and both parties consent to the divorce.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Separation for a continuous period of at least five years, regardless of whether your spouse consents to the divorce.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to note that if you and your spouse have been living separately but under the same roof, you will need to provide additional evidence to prove that you have been living separate lives. It is best to take the help of a <a href=\"https:\/\/murphysolicitors.co.uk\/divorce\/\" title=\"divorce lawyer\">divorce lawyer<\/a> to get accurate advice. Our <a href=\"https:\/\/murphysolicitors.co.uk\/\" title=\"\">law firm in <\/a> always offers you the best legal assistance. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to meeting the eligibility requirements, it is also important to consider the financial and practical implications of divorce. It is recommended that you seek legal advice before proceeding with a divorce to ensure that you understand your rights and obligations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Starting the Divorce Process<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have decided to end your marriage and are considering a divorce, the first step is to start the divorce process. In Lebanon, the process of getting a divorce can be complex and time-consuming, so it&#8217;s important to understand the steps involved before you begin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Completing the Petition<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step in starting the divorce process is to complete a divorce petition. This is a legal document that outlines the reasons for the divorce and the terms of the separation. The petition must be completed accurately and in detail, as any errors or omissions could delay the process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Filing for Divorce<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have completed the divorce petition, the next step is to file it with the court. This involves submitting the petition to the relevant court along with a fee. The court will then review the petition and determine if it meets the legal requirements for a divorce.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Serving the Divorce Papers<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After the court has reviewed and approved your divorce petition, you will need to serve the divorce papers on your spouse. This involves delivering a copy of the petition to your spouse, either in person or by post. Your spouse will then have a set amount of time to respond to the petition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, starting the divorce process in Lebanon can be a complicated and lengthy process. It&#8217;s important to seek legal advice and guidance to ensure that you understand your rights and obligations throughout the process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Response to Divorce Petition<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have received the divorce petition from your spouse, you have a few options for how to respond. It is important to respond within the given time frame, which is usually 21 days from the date of service.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your response should be filed with the court and a copy should be sent to your spouse. You can respond by either agreeing or disagreeing with the grounds for divorce stated in the petition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you agree with the grounds for divorce, you can file a document called an &#8220;Acknowledgment of Service&#8221; with the court. This document confirms that you have received the petition and agree to the divorce. You do not need to attend any court hearings if you file this document.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you disagree with the grounds for divorce, you can file a document called an &#8220;Answer&#8221; with the court. This document sets out the reasons why you disagree with the grounds for divorce and any other relevant information. You may need to attend a court hearing if you file an Answer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to seek legal advice before responding to a divorce petition, especially if you disagree with the grounds for divorce or if there are other issues, such as financial matters or child custody, that need to be addressed. A solicitor can help you understand your rights and options and guide you through the divorce process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Financial Settlements<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to divorce in Lebanon, sorting out the financial settlements can be a complex and challenging process. Here are some important things you need to know about financial settlements:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Financial Disclosure<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before any financial settlement can be reached, both parties are required to provide full and frank disclosure of their financial circumstances. This includes details of all assets, income, debts, and liabilities. This information is used to determine a fair and equitable settlement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Negotiating Settlements<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once financial disclosure has been provided, negotiations can begin. It is important to approach negotiations in a calm and reasonable manner. Both parties should aim to reach a settlement that is fair and reasonable for both parties. Negotiations can take place between the parties themselves, or with the assistance of a mediator or solicitor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Court Orders for Finances<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If negotiations fail, it may be necessary to apply for a court order for finances. This involves making an application to the court for a financial settlement. The court will take into account all of the relevant circumstances, including the needs of any children, before making a decision.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, financial settlements can be a complex and challenging process. It is important to seek professional advice and guidance to ensure that you achieve a fair and reasonable settlement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Child Arrangements<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Child Custody and Access<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When a married couple with children decides to divorce, the issue of child custody and access can be one of the most difficult and emotional aspects of the divorce process. In Lebanon, the courts make decisions based on the best interests of the child, taking into account factors such as the child&#8217;s age, their relationship with each parent, and their wishes and feelings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several types of custody arrangements that can be made, including joint custody, sole custody, and shared custody. Joint custody means that both parents have equal responsibility for making decisions about the child&#8217;s upbringing, while sole custody means that one parent has primary responsibility for the child. Shared custody is a variation of joint custody where the child spends a significant amount of time with both parents.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Access arrangements determine how much time the child spends with each parent. The court may order a specific schedule or leave it up to the parents to come to an agreement. It is important to note that access arrangements can be changed if circumstances change, such as a parent moving away or a child&#8217;s needs changing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Child Maintenance Agreements<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Child maintenance is financial support paid by one parent to the other to help with the costs of raising a child. In Lebanon, parents are encouraged to come to an agreement on child maintenance without going to court. This can be done through a family-based arrangement or through the Child Maintenance Service.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A family-based arrangement is an agreement made between the parents without involving any third parties. This can be a simple agreement to pay a set amount each month or a more detailed agreement that covers things like school fees and medical expenses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the parents cannot come to an agreement, they can use the Child Maintenance Service. This is a government-run service that calculates the amount of maintenance to be paid based on the non-resident parent&#8217;s income. The service can also collect and enforce payments if necessary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, child arrangements are an important part of the divorce process in Lebanon. It is important to approach these issues with a clear head and a focus on the best interests of the child. By working together and coming to a fair agreement, parents can ensure that their child&#8217;s needs are met and that they can move forward in a positive way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Decree Nisi and Decree Absolute<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In Lebanon, the divorce process involves obtaining a Decree Nisi and a Decree Absolute. These are legal documents that mark important stages in the divorce process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Applying for Decree Nisi<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To apply for a Decree Nisi, you must have already filed a Divorce Petition and received a response from your spouse. If your spouse agrees to the divorce, you can apply for a Decree Nisi by completing a form and submitting it to the court.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the court receives your application, a judge will review it and if satisfied, they will issue a Decree Nisi. This document confirms that the court agrees that you are entitled to a divorce. However, it does not end your marriage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Granting of Decree Absolute<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After the Decree Nisi has been granted, you must wait for a period of at least six weeks before applying for a Decree Absolute. This waiting period is designed to allow time for any financial or property issues to be resolved.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To apply for a Decree Absolute, you must complete another form and submit it to the court. If the court is satisfied that you are entitled to a divorce and that no further issues need to be addressed, they will issue a Decree Absolute.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Decree Absolute is the final legal document in the divorce process. It officially ends your marriage and allows you to remarry if you wish to do so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to note that obtaining a Decree Nisi and Decree Absolute can be a complex process. It is recommended that you seek legal advice to ensure that you understand your rights and obligations throughout the divorce process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Alternative Dispute Resolution<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you and your spouse are unable to reach an agreement through negotiation, you may want to consider alternative dispute resolution (ADR) as an option for resolving your divorce. ADR can be a less stressful and more cost-effective way to settle disputes than going to court.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One type of ADR is mediation, which involves a neutral third party who helps you and your spouse come to an agreement on issues such as property division, child custody, and support. Mediation is voluntary, confidential, and flexible. The mediator does not make decisions for you, but rather facilitates communication and helps you reach a mutually acceptable solution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another type of ADR is collaborative law, which involves each spouse hiring their own lawyer to help them negotiate a settlement. The lawyers work together to find a solution that meets both parties&#8217; needs. If an agreement cannot be reached, the lawyers must withdraw from the case and the spouses must hire new lawyers to go to court.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arbitration is another option for ADR, where a neutral third party makes a binding decision on the issues in dispute. This can be a quicker and less formal process than going to court, but it may not be suitable for all cases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, ADR can be a useful tool for resolving disputes in a divorce, but it is important to carefully consider whether it is the right option for you and your spouse. It is also important to choose a reputable ADR provider and to ensure that any agreement reached is legally binding.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Court Hearings and Trials<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When a divorce case goes to court in Lebanon, it usually means that both parties have failed to reach an agreement through mediation or negotiation. The court hearing is a formal process where both parties present their cases and evidence to a judge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The judge will then make a decision based on the evidence presented and the law. The judge may also ask questions and seek clarification from the parties or their legal representatives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to note that court hearings can be stressful and emotionally draining for both parties. It is recommended that you seek the advice of a qualified solicitor to represent you in court.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In some cases, a trial may be necessary if there are disputed facts or complex legal issues. A trial is a more formal process than a court hearing and involves presenting evidence and arguments to a judge over a number of days or weeks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During a trial, both parties will have the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses and challenge evidence presented by the other side. The judge will then make a final decision on the case.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to be well-prepared for a court hearing or trial. This includes gathering all necessary evidence and documents, having a clear understanding of your legal rights and obligations, and being able to present your case in a clear and concise manner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Legal Representation and Support<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are considering a divorce in Lebanon, you may want to seek legal representation and support. A solicitor can provide you with legal advice and guide you through the divorce process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to choose a solicitor who is experienced in family law and has a good reputation. You can find a solicitor through the Law Society of Lebanon or by asking for recommendations from friends and family.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your solicitor can help you with a range of issues related to your divorce, including:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Filing the divorce petition<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Negotiating a settlement agreement<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Representing you in court<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Advising you on child custody and support<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Helping you with property and financial matters<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to legal representation, you may also want to seek support from a counsellor or therapist. Divorce can be a difficult and emotional process, and it can be helpful to have someone to talk to who can provide you with emotional support and guidance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many organisations in Lebanon that provide support for people going through a divorce, including Relate NI and the Family Mediation NI. These organisations can provide you with counselling, mediation services, and other forms of support.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, seeking legal representation and support can help you navigate the divorce process and ensure that your rights are protected.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Frequently Asked Questions<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What are the grounds for obtaining a divorce in Lebanon?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In Lebanon, the grounds for obtaining a divorce are quite similar to those in other parts of the UK. You can obtain a divorce if your marriage has irretrievably broken down, and you can prove one of the following grounds: adultery, unreasonable behaviour, desertion for at least two years, separation for at least two years with the consent of your spouse, or separation for at least five years without the consent of your spouse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How can one initiate the divorce proceedings?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To initiate the divorce proceedings in Lebanon, you will need to fill out a divorce petition and file it with the court. You will also need to pay a fee, which can vary depending on your circumstances. Once the petition has been filed, you will need to serve it on your spouse, who will have an opportunity to respond. If your spouse agrees to the divorce, the process can be relatively straightforward. However, if your spouse contests the divorce, the process can be more complex and may require a court hearing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What is the average duration of the divorce process?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The duration of the divorce process in Lebanon can vary depending on the circumstances of your case. If your divorce is uncontested and proceeds smoothly, it can take around four to six months from the date of filing to obtain a decree absolute. However, if your divorce is contested, it can take significantly longer, and may require multiple court hearings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How is the division of assets handled in a settlement?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The division of assets in a settlement is an important aspect of the divorce process. In Lebanon, the court will consider a range of factors when deciding how to divide assets, including the length of the marriage, the financial resources of each party, and the needs of any children. The court will aim to achieve a fair and equitable division of assets, which may involve selling property, dividing pensions, or making lump sum payments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What are the costs associated with filing for divorce?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several costs associated with filing for divorce in Lebanon. These include the court fee, which can vary depending on your circumstances, and any legal fees you may incur if you choose to hire a solicitor. If your case goes to court, there may be additional costs associated with court hearings and expert witnesses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What steps are involved in legally separating from a spouse?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are not ready to obtain a divorce, you may wish to consider legally separating from your spouse. To do this, you will need to draw up a separation agreement, which sets out the terms of your separation, including arrangements for children, finances, and property. Once the agreement has been signed, it can be made legally binding by the court. Legal separation can be a useful option for couples who are not yet ready to divorce, but wish to live apart and make separate arrangements for their future.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you are considering divorce in Lebanon, it is important to understand the legal process and requirements involved.
