There is no simple guide for claimants as to what their claim may be worth.  After being involved in an accident it can be a confusing and stressful time.  This article today will help to take away some of that confusion by giving you a general guide as to what certain categories of personal injuries may be worth.  Please note this article is a general guide and should not be taken or relied on as legal advice.  We have focused on a selection of some of the main types of injuries that we see in the <a href=\"https:\/\/murphysolicitors.co.uk\/personal-injury-claims\/\" title=\"personal injury claims \">personal injury claims <\/a>that we deal with. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"gdlr-core-space-shortcode\" style=\"margin-top: 30px ;\"  ><\/span>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery aligncenter has-nested-images columns-3 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/murphysolicitors.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/owen-beard-DK8jXx1B-1c-unsplash-scaled.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"819\" height=\"1024\" data-id=\"7155\" src=\"https:\/\/murphysolicitors.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/owen-beard-DK8jXx1B-1c-unsplash-819x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Medical Negligence\" class=\"wp-image-7155\" srcset=\"https:\/\/murphysolicitors.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/owen-beard-DK8jXx1B-1c-unsplash-819x1024.jpg 819w, https:\/\/murphysolicitors.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/owen-beard-DK8jXx1B-1c-unsplash-240x300.jpg 240w, https:\/\/murphysolicitors.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/owen-beard-DK8jXx1B-1c-unsplash-768x960.jpg 768w, https:\/\/murphysolicitors.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/owen-beard-DK8jXx1B-1c-unsplash-1229x1536.jpg 1229w, https:\/\/murphysolicitors.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/owen-beard-DK8jXx1B-1c-unsplash-1638x2048.jpg 1638w, https:\/\/murphysolicitors.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/owen-beard-DK8jXx1B-1c-unsplash-scaled.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/murphysolicitors.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Insurance-Law1200.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"401\" data-id=\"6685\" src=\"https:\/\/murphysolicitors.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Insurance-Law1200-1024x401.jpg\" alt=\"personal injury\" class=\"wp-image-6685\" srcset=\"https:\/\/murphysolicitors.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Insurance-Law1200-1024x401.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/murphysolicitors.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Insurance-Law1200-600x235.jpg 600w, https:\/\/murphysolicitors.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Insurance-Law1200-300x118.jpg 300w, https:\/\/murphysolicitors.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Insurance-Law1200-768x301.jpg 768w, https:\/\/murphysolicitors.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Insurance-Law1200.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/murphysolicitors.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Health-Care-Law1200.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"401\" data-id=\"6692\" src=\"https:\/\/murphysolicitors.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Health-Care-Law1200-1024x401.jpg\" alt=\"Medical Negligence Solicitors\" class=\"wp-image-6692\" srcset=\"https:\/\/murphysolicitors.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Health-Care-Law1200-1024x401.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/murphysolicitors.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Health-Care-Law1200-600x235.jpg 600w, https:\/\/murphysolicitors.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Health-Care-Law1200-300x118.jpg 300w, https:\/\/murphysolicitors.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Health-Care-Law1200-768x301.jpg 768w, https:\/\/murphysolicitors.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Health-Care-Law1200.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n<\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"psychiatric-harm\">Psychiatric Harm<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Psychiatric harm can arise in many types of claims, from a bullying and harassment case to mental health problems caused by a breach of personal data.  The court when valuing psychiatric harm will take into account factors such as :<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>ability to cope with life, education and work<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>effect on relationships<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>whether treatment would be successful<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>prognosis and future vulnerability<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>and extent of associated physical injuries<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The claims awarded can vary a lot depending on the above factors and the injuries are categorised into broad categories as follows:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Severe psychiatric damage.  Where the prognosis is very poor for the claimant an award between \u00a382,000 and \u00a3210,000 is estimated.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>More moderately severe psychiatric damage is likely to command an award between \u00a347,500 and \u00a3125,000.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Moderate psychiatric injuries normally fall within a bracket of \u00a312,000 &#8211; \u00a348,500 and<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Minor psychiatric damage claims can be worth up to \u00a315,000. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to general psychiatric harm, post traumatic stress disorder injuries can expect awards in the region of the following:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Severe cases which will involve permanent effects which will prevent the claimant from working or functioning at anything approaching the pre incident level can reach awards of between \u00a360,000 to \u00a3120,000.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Moderately severe.  Where some recovery is expected then the award may reach between \u00a345,000 to \u00a395,000.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Moderate.  Where the claimant has largely recovered then the estimated value of their case is between \u00a312,000 to \u00a348,500.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>In minor cases the award can be between \u00a34,500 and \u00a313,000. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"neck-injuries\">Neck Injuries<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There can be a wide variance of the types of neck injuries that we come across in personal injury claims.
