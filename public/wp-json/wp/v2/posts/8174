On average, <strong>most divorces take at least six months<\/strong> to complete. It&#8217;s important to note that this estimate only covers the divorce proceedings, while the division of finances and establishing child arrangements can take additional time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Going through a divorce can be an emotionally challenging and often time-consuming process. Understanding the duration of the divorce process can help you better prepare for what lies ahead. In this article, we will discuss how long it typically takes to get divorced in England and Wales, while considering the various stages involved in finalising a divorce.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The recent changes in<a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/news\/new-divorce-laws-will-come-into-force-from-6-april-2022\"><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color\"> UK divorce law<\/mark><\/a> have aimed to make the process smoother by reducing conflicts and allowing for no-fault divorces. As part of these reforms, a minimum period of 20 weeks between the start of proceedings and the application for a conditional order is now in place to provide couples with an opportunity for reflection and potential reconciliation. Nevertheless, the overall timeline for completing a divorce remains influenced by the complexities of each individual case.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Understanding the Divorce Process<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1<\/strong>. <strong>Initiating Divorce<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To start the divorce process, you need to fill out a divorce application. This can be either a <strong>joint application<\/strong> with your spouse or a <strong>sole application<\/strong> if you&#8217;re applying alone. In a sole application, you become the <em>applicant<\/em>, and your spouse is the <em>respondent<\/em>. Once the application is completed, it can be submitted to the court, either in person or using the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/get-a-divorce\"><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color\"> online application form<\/mark><\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After submitting the application, the court sends an <strong>acknowledgement of service<\/strong> form to the respondent, who must fill it out and return it. This confirms they have received the application and also gives them time to file any objections.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2<\/strong>. <strong>Interim Stages<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the court receives the acknowledgement of service, it checks if there&#8217;s enough reason to grant the divorce. If the court is satisfied, it issues a <strong>certificate of entitlement<\/strong> listing the date the divorce will be considered.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next stage involves obtaining the <strong>conditional order<\/strong>, previously known as a <strong>decree nisi<\/strong>. You need to wait at least 20 weeks after submitting the divorce application before being able to apply for this order. The conditional order is essentially the court&#8217;s decision to grant the divorce, making you one step closer to finalising the dissolution of your marriage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3<\/strong>. <strong>Finalising the Divorce<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To finalise the divorce, you must apply for the <strong>final order<\/strong>, formerly called the <strong>decree absolute<\/strong>. This is typically done 6 weeks after receiving the conditional order. To apply for the final order, you must fill out a specific form provided by the court.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be aware that the length of the divorce process depends on the complexity of your situation, and it can take longer if there are disagreements over financial matters, property, or child arrangements. According to the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.chubb-bulleid.co.uk\/insights\/articles\/divorce-uk-divorce-divorce-rules\/\"><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color\"> new UK divorce rules<\/mark><\/a>, the entire divorce process can take a minimum of 6 months.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, finding agreements on finances and child arrangements are separate processes that can take less or more time, depending on your circumstances. It is important to be patient and be prepared for possible delays during the course of your divorce proceedings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Key Factors Influencing Divorce Duration<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1<\/strong>. <strong>Type of Divorce<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The type of divorce you are pursuing has a significant impact on the length of time it can take to finalise the process. In England and Wales, it now takes a minimum of 26 weeks (6 months) to get a divorce under the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.chubb-bulleid.co.uk\/insights\/articles\/divorce-uk-divorce-divorce-rules\/\"><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color\"> new UK divorce rules<\/mark><\/a>. Keep in mind that this only covers the divorce proceedings, and does not include other processes such as asset division or child arrangements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Complexity of Asset Division<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>division of finances<\/strong> in a divorce can be a complex matter and affect the overall duration of the process. If you and your spouse have intricate assets, such as property, <em>pensions<\/em>, or investments, the division might take longer to settle. A divorce solicitor can provide valuable legal advice during this stage, ensuring that all financial matters &#8211; from joint accounts to matrimonial assets &#8211; are handled fairly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3.<\/strong> <strong>Child Arrangements and Support<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have children, <em>child arrangements<\/em> and support can also affect the duration of your divorce. In some cases, a<a href=\"https:\/\/www.familydivorcelawyer.co.uk\/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-a-divorce-in-the-uk\/\"><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color\"> Child Arrangements Order<\/mark><\/a> may need to be issued by the court if both parties cannot agree on arrangements like custody and visitation. This can lengthen the process significantly, especially if there is ongoing conflict between you and your partner. It&#8217;s crucial to work with a solicitor who has experience in handling child arrangement cases to ensure that the best interests of your children are prioritised.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Cooperation Between Parties<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The level of cooperation between you and your spouse plays a major role in determining how long your divorce might take. If both parties are agreeable and work together to settle financial issues, the divorce can be granted within<a href=\"https:\/\/www.slatergordon.co.uk\/newsroom\/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-a-divorce-in-the-uk\/\"><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color\"> six months<\/mark><\/a>. However, if there is a significant amount of conflict or disagreement, the process could be significantly delayed. It is essential to try and maintain open communication and compromise where possible, while also seeking legal advice from a qualified solicitor to ensure your rights are protected.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking for a <a href=\"https:\/\/murphysolicitors.co.uk\/divorce\/\" title=\"\"><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color\">divorce solicitor <\/mark><\/a>?
