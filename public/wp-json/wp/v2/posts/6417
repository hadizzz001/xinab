Jump on the phone, or even better turn up at their office.  Customers find it a lot easier to ignore a chasing email email or letter than having to explain themselves directly to you.  If this doesn&#8217;t work then you should speak to a specialised debt collection solicitor as soon as possible.  Try not to delay, a customer is more likely to treat you seriously if you show that you are determined to chase the debt and accept no excuses.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-will-your-solicitor-do\">What will your solicitor do?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First step is your solicitor should serve on the non paying customer a pre-action letter of claim.  The letter of claim will set out the details of any contract, what you are owed, interest due and timeframe for when you will take further action if the money is not repaid.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the outstanding monies are not repaid following the letter of claim, then your solicitor has two main options:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Issue court proceedings for the debt<\/li><li>Issue bankruptcy\/winding up proceedings against the debtor<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"issue-court-proceedings\">Issue court proceedings<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If there is a reasonable dispute in regards to the debt being owed, then you should initiate proceedings in the civil courts to obtain a court judgment against the debtor.  You will be seeking from the court a judgment that includes the principal sum owed, plus interest, plus your legal costs.  The court proceedings if defended will take some time before you will get your case into court and obtain a judgment.  How long that will be will depend on how complex or not the case is and the court&#8217;s timetable.  Once you are awarded a judgment, the debtor will normally at that stage pay up.  If they do not you have two options:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>Proceed to Enforcement of Judgments Office. <\/strong>The Enforcement of Judgments Office job it is to enforce court orders.  They will for a fee attempt to obtain the monies outstanding as set out in the court judgment.<\/li><li><strong>Bankruptcy\/Winding up Proceedings<\/strong>. You can proceed to apply to make a person bankrupt or wind up a company, if there is no reasonable dispute in regards to the debt being due and owing.  Therefore if there is no reasonable dispute you can proceed to bankruptcy\/winding up proceedings without needing to obtain a court order beforehand.  Or you can obtain a court order and then proceed.  <\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p><strong>The above gives you an outline of some of the options open to you when a customer refuses to pay.
