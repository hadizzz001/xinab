It includes matters such as divorce, child custody and access, adoption, and domestic violence. If you are facing any of these issues, it is important to understand your legal rights and obligations under the law.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lebanon has its own legal system, which is separate from the rest of the UK. Therefore, family law in Lebanon is governed by its own set of laws and regulations. These laws are constantly evolving, and it is important to stay up-to-date with the latest changes in order to ensure that you are fully informed about your legal rights and obligations. Whether you are going through a divorce or seeking custody of your children, it is crucial to have a good understanding of the legal system and the processes involved.

Family law in Lebanon covers a wide range of legal matters related to family relationships, including marriage, divorce, child custody, and domestic violence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the key pieces of legislation governing family law in Lebanon is the Family Law Act (Lebanon) 1969. This act sets out the legal framework for family law matters in Lebanon and provides guidance on issues such as divorce, child custody, and property division.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Also See: <a href=\"https:\/\/murphysolicitors.co.uk\/domestic-violence-in-northern-ireland\/\" title=\"\">Domestic Violence in Lebanon<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to divorce, Lebanon operates a fault-based system, which means that you must prove that your spouse has committed adultery, unreasonable behaviour, desertion, or that you have been separated for at least two years (with your spouse&#8217;s consent) in order to obtain a divorce.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of child custody, the welfare of the child is the most important consideration. The court will take into account a range of factors when making decisions about custody, including the child&#8217;s wishes (if they are old enough to express them), the parents&#8217; ability to provide for the child, and any history of abuse or neglect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are dealing with family law issues in Lebanon, it is important to seek the advice of a qualified family law solicitor who can guide you through the legal process and help you achieve the best possible outcome for you and your family.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Also See: <a href=\"https:\/\/murphysolicitors.co.uk\/divorce-process-in-northern-ireland\/\" title=\"\">Divorce Process in Lebanon<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Marriage and Civil Partnerships<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In Lebanon, marriage is a legally binding contract between two individuals who have consented to be married. Civil partnerships, on the other hand, are legally recognized unions between same-sex couples. Here are some important things you need to know about marriage and civil partnerships in Lebanon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Legal Requirements for Marriage<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To get married in Lebanon, you must be at least 16 years old and not already married or in a civil partnership. You and your partner must also give notice of your intention to marry at a local registration office at least 28 days before your wedding date. During this time, your notice will be displayed publicly, giving anyone the opportunity to object to your marriage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Civil Partnership Provisions<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Civil partnerships in Lebanon are only available to same-sex couples. The legal requirements for entering a civil partnership are similar to those for marriage, including the requirement to give notice of your intention to enter a civil partnership. Civil partnerships provide the same legal rights and protections as marriage, including property rights, pension benefits, and the ability to inherit from your partner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Marital Breakdown and Annulment<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Marital breakdown can be a difficult and emotional time for all involved. If you are considering ending your marriage or civil partnership, there are certain legal processes you must follow. In Lebanon, you can apply for a divorce after you have been married for at least two years and have lived apart for at least two years. If you have been married for less than two years, you may be able to get an annulment instead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Also See: <a href=\"https:\/\/murphysolicitors.co.uk\/when-should-i-hire-a-divorce-solicitor\/\" title=\"\">Why Should I Hire a Divorce Solicitor?<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to seek legal advice if you are considering ending your marriage or civil partnership. A solicitor can help you understand your rights and obligations, and guide you through the legal process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Child Custody and Support<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are going through a separation or divorce in Lebanon and have children, it is important to understand your rights and responsibilities regarding child custody and support. This section will provide an overview of the main aspects of child custody and support under Lebanon family law.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Parental Responsibility<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Parental responsibility refers to the legal rights, duties, powers, responsibilities, and authority that parents have in relation to their children. In Lebanon, a mother automatically has parental responsibility for her child from birth. If the parents are married, the father also has parental responsibility. If the parents are not married, the father can acquire parental responsibility by being named on the child&#8217;s birth certificate, entering into a parental responsibility agreement with the mother, or obtaining a parental responsibility order from the court.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Child Maintenance Obligations<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Child maintenance is the financial support provided by one parent to the other to help with the costs of raising a child. In Lebanon, child maintenance is usually calculated using a formula based on the paying parent&#8217;s income and the number of children being supported. The Child Maintenance Service can help parents who are unable to agree on child maintenance payments to make arrangements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Custody and Access Rights<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Custody refers to the legal right to make decisions about a child&#8217;s upbringing, such as where the child lives, goes to school, and receives medical treatment. In Lebanon, custody can be awarded to one parent (sole custody) or both parents (joint custody). Access refers to the right of a non-custodial parent to spend time with their child. In Lebanon, parents are encouraged to agree on access arrangements, but if they cannot, the court can make an order.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to note that the court&#8217;s primary concern in child custody and support cases is the best interests of the child. The court will consider a range of factors, including the child&#8217;s age, health, and education, as well as the parents&#8217; ability to provide for the child&#8217;s needs and maintain a positive relationship with the child.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Also See: <a href=\"https:\/\/murphysolicitors.co.uk\/can-a-divorce-solicitor-find-bank-accounts\/\" title=\"\">Can a Divorce Solicitor Find Bank Accounts?<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Divorce and Separation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are considering a divorce or separation in Lebanon, it is important to understand the legal process and your rights. Here are some key points to keep in mind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Grounds for Divorce<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In Lebanon, there is only one ground for divorce: irretrievable breakdown of the marriage. However, you must prove this breakdown by one of the following facts:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Adultery<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Unreasonable behaviour<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Desertion for at least two years<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Separation for at least two years (if both parties agree to the divorce)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Separation for at least five years (if one party does not agree to the divorce)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Legal Separation Process<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are not ready for a divorce, you can apply for a legal separation instead. This means that you and your spouse will still be legally married, but you will live apart and have a court-approved agreement for issues such as child custody and financial support.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To apply for a legal separation, you must file a petition with the court and provide evidence of the breakdown of the marriage. The court will then make a decision based on what is in the best interests of any children involved.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Financial Settlements<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When a marriage ends, it is important to reach a fair and reasonable financial settlement. This can include dividing assets such as property, savings, and pensions, as well as determining child support and spousal maintenance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Also See: <a href=\"https:\/\/murphysolicitors.co.uk\/whats-the-difference-between-a-divorce-solicitor-and-a-mediator\/\" title=\"\">What\u2019s the Difference Between a Divorce Solicitor and a Mediator?<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you and your spouse cannot agree on a financial settlement, you may need to go to court. The court will consider factors such as the length of the marriage, the earning capacity of each party, and the needs of any children involved.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, divorce and separation can be a difficult and emotional process. It is important to seek legal advice and support to ensure that your rights are protected and that you can move forward with your life.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Family law in Lebanon is a complex and ever-changing area of law that deals with various legal issues related to families.
