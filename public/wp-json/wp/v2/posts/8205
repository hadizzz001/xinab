When seeking medical attention, you are entitled to a minimum standard of care, known as the duty of care. However, in instances where you feel that your healthcare provider failed to uphold this standard, you may consider filing a medical negligence claim to seek compensation for the harm you suffered.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To successfully file a medical negligence claim, <strong>you must prove two fundamental aspects; <\/strong>breach of duty and causation. <strong>Breach of duty <\/strong>involves demonstrating that a medical professional&#8217;s actions (or inactions) deviated from the acceptable standard of care expected in their field. <strong>Causation,<\/strong> also known as avoidable harm, requires you to establish that your injuries were a direct result of the medical professional&#8217;s negligence \u2013 not an existing condition or an unavoidable complication.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Determining breach of duty and establishing causation in medical negligence cases require a comprehensive understanding of medical practices, obtaining relevant medical records, and expert testimonies. This process can be complex and time-consuming, which is why many find it hard to prove medical negligence. However, with a clear understanding of your rights and the legal requirements to file such a claim, you can confidently pursue justice for the harm you experienced.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Complexities of Proving Medical Negligence<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Establishing a Breach of Duty<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When pursuing a <em>medical negligence claim<\/em>, one of the main challenges you face is proving that the healthcare professional, such as a doctor, breached their <em>duty of care<\/em>. To establish this, you must demonstrate that the <em>standard of care<\/em> you received fell below what a reasonably competent medical professional would have provided in similar circumstances<a href=\"https:\/\/koala.sh\/article?articleId=eca602e8-85f6-4698-a1de-f1226e29acbe#user-content-fn-1%5E\"> <sup>1<\/sup><\/a>. Gathering <em>evidence<\/em> to prove this breach is often difficult, as it may involve dissecting complex medical records and seeking opinions from qualified <em>medical experts<\/em>. Typically, your <em>solicitor<\/em> plays a significant role in this process, guiding you and collating the necessary evidence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Demonstrating Causation<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another major hurdle in proving <em>medical negligence<\/em> is showing causation \u2013 that the breach of duty directly caused, or significantly contributed to, your injury or negative outcome. This can be challenging as many patients already have existing medical conditions, and it may be hard to separate the consequences of negligence from the natural progression of their condition. Therefore, it is crucial to have <em>medical experts<\/em> provide their opinions on how the negligence affected your health.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Bolam Test and Standard of Care<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The <em>Bolam test<\/em> is a key legal principle utilised in <em>medical negligence<\/em> cases in the UK. This test is used to determine the <em>standard of care<\/em> expected from a healthcare professional. Essentially, the Bolam test states that a doctor is not deemed negligent if their actions are supported by a &#8220;responsible body of <a href=\"https:\/\/koala.sh\/article?articleId=eca602e8-85f6-4698-a1de-f1226e29acbe#user-content-fn-2%5E\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">medical opinion<\/a>. As a claimant, you may find it challenging to prove your case if a group of medical professionals testifies that the treatment provided was in line with accepted practice, even though your outcome was unsatisfactory. Engaging a skilled <em>solicitor<\/em> with experience in <em>clinical negligence<\/em> cases can help you navigate these complexities and increase the likelihood of a successful claim.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Footnotes<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wilsonbrowne.co.uk\/news\/how-hard-is-it-to-prove-medical-negligence\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\"><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color\">Wilson Browne: How Hard is it to Prove Medical Negligence?<\/mark><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/koala.sh\/article?articleId=eca602e8-85f6-4698-a1de-f1226e29acbe#user-content-fnref-1%5E\"> \u21a9<br><\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.legalexpert.co.uk\/clinical-medical-negligence\/how-hard-is-it-to-prove-medical-negligence\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\"><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color\">Legal Expert: How Hard Is It To Prove Medical Negligence?<\/mark><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/koala.sh\/article?articleId=eca602e8-85f6-4698-a1de-f1226e29acbe#user-content-fnref-2%5E\"> \u21a9<br><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Legal and Medical Assessment Procedures<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Gathering and Analysing Medical Evidence<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you&#8217;re dealing with a medical negligence claim, one of the most crucial aspects is the collection and examination of medical evidence. This might include your <strong>medical records<\/strong>, witness statements, and any other relevant documentation. Obtaining the necessary evidence is essential to establish the burden of proof in a medical negligence case, which lies with the <strong>claimant<\/strong>. Thoroughly analysing this information and identifying any discrepancies in your care can greatly support your claim.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Role of Expert Witnesses<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In many instances, input from an <strong>independent medical expert<\/strong> is required to determine whether the level of care provided fell short of expected professional standards. Expert witnesses have relevant knowledge and experience in the specific medical field relevant to your case, which allows them to provide an informed assessment of your situation. Their testimony, based on medical records and other evidence, can help to reinforce your claim and provide the grounds for pursuing legal action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Time Limit and Legal Advice<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When dealing with medical negligence cases, it is essential to be mindful of the <strong>time limit<\/strong> for making a claim. In the UK, you generally have 3 years from the date of the incident or the date you became aware of the negligence to commence legal proceedings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seeking <strong>legal advice<\/strong> from a qualified solicitor specialising in medical negligence claims is highly recommended. <strong>Solicitors<\/strong> can provide essential guidance on building a strong case, evaluating the likelihood of success, and navigating the complex legal process involved in making a claim. They can help with gathering evidence, obtaining witness statements, and enlisting the support of expert witnesses to strengthen your case.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Book a <a href=\"https:\/\/murphysolicitors.co.uk\/contact-us\/\"><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color\">free consultation<\/mark><\/a> now to speak to an <a href=\"https:\/\/murphysolicitors.co.uk\/medical-negligence-solicitors\/\" title=\"\"><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color\">medical solicitors <\/mark><\/a> who can guide you as to what your case is worth, taking in to account the specific circumstances of your case.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"gdlr-core-space-shortcode\" style=\"margin-top: 30px ;\"  ><\/span>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Medical negligence cases can be challenging to prove due to the complexities involved in the medical field and the evidence required to support your claim.
